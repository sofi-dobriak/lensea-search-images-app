# 🔎Image Search App

This project allows users to search for images using keywords.
The user can input search queries, and the app will display relevant images from an external API.

### 🧾Key Features:

#### 🔹 **Image Search:**

Enter keywords in the input field to search for related images.

#### 🔹 **No Results Message:**

If no images are found for your search, a message will be displayed: "No images found for your search. Try something else!".

#### 🔹 **Empty Input Handling:**

If the input is empty, an error message will be shown.

#### 🔹 **Server Error Handling:**

In case of issues with the server response, an error message will be displayed.

#### 🔹 **Pagination:**

Only 12 images are loaded per request. If more images are available, a "Load more" button will appear. If fewer than 12 images are found, the button will not be shown.

#### 🔹 **Loader:**

A loader is displayed during image loading to enhance the user experience.
