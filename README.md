# 🔎Image Search App

This project allows users to search for images using keywords. The user can input search queries, and the app will display relevant images from an external API.

### 🧾Key Features:

-   **Image Search:** Enter keywords in the input field to search for related images.
-   **No Results Message:** If no images are found for your search, a message will be displayed: "No images found for your search. Try something else!".
-   **Empty Input Handling:** If the input is empty, an error message will be shown.
-   **Server Error Handling:** In case of issues with the server response, an error message will be displayed.
-   **Pagination:** Only 12 images are loaded per request. If more images are available, a "Load more" button will appear. If fewer than 12 images are found, the button will not be shown.
-   **Loader:** A loader is displayed during image loading to enhance the user experience.
